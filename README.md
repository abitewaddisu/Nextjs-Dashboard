# Next.js Dashboard

This project is a Next.js dashboard that I developed as part of a course. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing data. The dashboard is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Features

- **Authentication**: The dashboard includes a secure authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Data Visualization**: It provides interactive charts and graphs to visualize data in a visually appealing and informative way.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on different devices.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators have access to additional features and can manage user accounts, data sources, and dashboard settings.
- **Data Management**: The dashboard allows users to import, export, and manipulate data from various sources, providing flexibility in data management.
